2020-02-02,"No, I don’t agree. $SBUX has a moat and it got a brand internationally recognised and hence much more valuable. It got the World as playing field. It’s easy to pop up stores at a loss. $LK top line growth came with a proportional growth in number of stores","Setting aside the fraud allegations, you simply can't compare the two on valuation at all. $SBUX top line is growing by mid-single digit. $LK is growing at 500%. Even if that slows to 100-200% top line growth, it should command a much higher multiple vs $SBUX",If we take $SBUX multiple and plug it into $LK it should be worth $10 a share given it’s a legit company and not fraudulent. If we hype it up as a growth and double up the multiple then $20. This should be the MAXIMUM. Likewise if we give it the doubt then $5. If fraud then 0,I repeat $LK is not a SaaS companies and should not be valued as such for the reasons I explained and should be crystal clear. Valuing $LK at 20x sales (TTM) is insane. Or let’s say 10x sales assuming sales doubled up vs $SBUX valued at 3.6x. It’s currently valued at a huge prem,"Haha, just surprised how many are calling $LK out 🤷‍♂️

The no. of Twitter followers provides an idea of the brand's loyalty.
 
Not a scientific way to measure the India potential of US brands. But seems US brands have a long way to go in India.

The India franchisees enjoy only a fraction of Twitter following of that of the US brands. 

Why is this data point relevant? Because the importance of Twitter to any consumer brand cannot be over emphasized.

Obviously, primary reason would be the under penetration of Twitter in India, v. US. While US has 59.35 mn Twitter users, India has 11.45 mn, in January 2020, or just 19% of the Twitter users in the US.
