Also, make sure the call doesn't actually end when all the hosts leave

I think that's it for now.

$HTZ","A postmortem

How to have an unsuccessful government conference call:

Send invites to thousands and thousands of unrelated parties

Limit call to 300 participants, with hundreds or thousands in the queue getting irate and wanting to scream their questions & intros

No mute

$HTZ","People now pretending to be the hosts and answering questions with ridiculous statements.

$HTZ","It's now a former employee chatroom.  I'm about to sign off.

I'm pretty sure that Michael Scott yelled ""I DECLARE BANKRUPTCY"" several times during the call.

$HTZ","This meeting is recorded and some sort of official Federal government record.  I'm thinking of filing a FOIA request.

$HTZ","Vendors' consensus is that this was ""sabotage.""

Lots of yelling and cussing, even though none of the hosts are still in the meeting.

$HTZ","Everyone is now yelling the date and time of the meeting continuation now.

$HTZ","Now there's cussing.  Shocked it's taken this long.

$HTZ",Lol I want the $HTZ one  https://twitter.com/WallStSupp/status/1278363429338853377 …,"Music in background now.

1 hour later, no information.  Attorneys and others yelling that the call is over.

$HTZ","U.S. Trustee asked if it may be more prudent to get a new conference call platform that mutes all callers and can selectively unmute.

Caller told to write to Congress to ask for more money.

$HTZ",Imagine the amount of government checks being wiped out when $HTZ becomes $HTZAQ.  And $WLL too.,"It's now a Trump debate, somehow.

$HTZ","Lots of new meeting entrants.  Every one giving an introduction.  Hunt for the U.S. Trustee ongoing.

$HTZ","Suggestion before that ""hello, hello"" may have been from a soundboard.  U.S. Trustee liked the idea.

$HTZ","U.S. Trustee may have just hung up.

$HTZ","We've got some Spanish-English confusion happening at the moment.

$HTZ","U.S. Trustee has given into one of the many ""hello, hello"" callers and wants their question, presumably to get them off the line.

Now everyone is shouting ""hello, hello.""

$HTZ","""Hello, hello"" followed by a ton of insults.

$HTZ","She now wants questions from individuals only.  No vendors, no attorneys.

""Females first.""  ""I only want to hear questions from individual females.""

Threatening to end the call.

$HTZ","About 50 different ""hellos.""

I think the analogy of Lord of the Flies without a conch stands.

An alarm of some sort is in the background.

$HTZ","Another spelling debacle taking place.

$HTZ",oh r we done buying $HTZ now?  pic.twitter.com/MIhyidJtIk,"New attendees now announcing themselves.  Lots of cross-talk, and now feedback noise overpowering everything.

$HTZ","U.S. Trustee just announced that she wants to take control of the meeting.  45 minutes in, it seems like that horse has left the barn and burned it down.

$HTZ","An attorney with a ""short question"" just got recognized.

Needless to say, the question was not ""short.""

She's being told that she's in the wrong forum.

Hertz company rep, U.S. Trustee, and lawyers all talking over each other saying that they will not answer the question.

$HTZ","The amount of paper wasted in sending letters to every. single. Hertz. customer. must have been astounding.  I'm sure their creditors will love that expense.

$HTZ","40 minutes in.  U.S. Trustee just announced that she's ""starting again.""

$HTZ","U.S. Trustee says that anyone who rented a car from Hertz was required to receive the letter about the call.

I reiterate that this call had a 300 person limit and no way to mute callers.

$HTZ","Random customers on the call asking random questions now.

$HTZ","URL being spelled out now.  This can only end poorly.

$HTZ","Lots of crosstalk in the background.  Now getting questions about severance pay that was promised, even in bankruptcy.

Lots of crosstalk in background.  Mute Olympics starting again.

U.S. Trustee is trying to introduce herself again.

$HTZ","They claim that vendors with continued business will be getting paid per normal.  Now everyone yelling that it's not happening.  I know it hasn't been happening.

$HTZ","$BYND bouncer 142c 🔥🔥🔥

Angry, angry vendor starts screaming ""THIS IS FOR VENDORS.  IF YOU'RE NOT A VENDOR GET OFF THE PHONE.""  Literally screaming.

$HTZ","U.S. Trustee introduced herself again.  Started spelling email for ex employee contact.  Now everyone is shouting letters at each other.  ""B as in boy!"" ""No, D as in David!"" ""G as in Glee!""

$HTZ","Just a shouting match now.  No one can hear anything.

$HTZ","Now a lengthy back and forth about secured and unsecured credit.  ""Wages are tricky.""

Still no statement from the U.S. Trustee, just Lord of the Flies with no conch.

$HTZ","We're nearly 20 minutes in, and have received no information.

It's been all Mute Olympics.

$HTZ","Seems a lot of past employees owed wages are on the call.  The 300 participant cap seems to lack foresight.

$HTZ","What Game Are You Playing?  http://blogs.ci.com/cambridge/brandon-snow/what-game-are-you-playing … A thoughtful blog from Brandon Snow.
